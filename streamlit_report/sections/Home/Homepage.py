The disorder is cronic, and characterized by a loss of cognitive funtioning and memory beyond what is normally seen in older people. Knowledge about the disease is limited, resulting in gaps in understanding its underlying pathology, hindering accurate diagnosis, and effective treatment development. Robust biomarkers of the disease can help address the current gaps in knowledge. This Streamlit app showcases the work and results from a prospective case-cohort study on plasma protein biomarkers for dementia. The proteomes were inferred through liquid chromatograby (LC) mass spectrometry (MS) from baseline plasma samples of case-cohort nested iwthing the Systolic blood PRessure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) in a prospective manner.  The study was done in connection to Josefine Meineche's master's thesis conducted at the Center for Biosustainability at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) in partional completion of the Master of science in engineering in bioinformatics and systems biology. The study was done in collaboration with the Bio-Epi group at the Section of Epidemiology, University of Copenhagen.  - Supervisor: Alberto Santos Delgado, DTU Biosustain - Co-supervisor: Henry Webel, DTU Biosustan - External co-supervisor: Majken Karoline Jensen, Section of Epidemilogy UCPH
